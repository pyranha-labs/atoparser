"""Helpers used to serialize/deserialize Atop statistics directly from log files.

The basic layout of an Atop log file can be described as the following:
1. Raw Header:
    - Single instance at the beginning of the file.
    - Contains information about all the following raw records.
2. Raw Record:
    - Single instance repeated in a loop with remaining stats until end of file.
    - Contains information about the *Stat structs that immediately follow it.
3. Raw SStat:
    - Single instance repeated in a loop with remaining stats until end of file.
    - Always found directly after a Record.
    - Always found directly before a TStat array.
    - Contains statistics about overall system activity.
4. Raw TStats:
    - Array of TStat instances repeated in a loop with remaining stats until end of file.
    - Always found directly after a SStat.
    - Always found directly before the next Record (if <= 2.11) or before a CStat array (if 2.11+).
    - Contains statistics about every task/process on the system.
4. Raw CStats/CGroups:
    - Array of CStat/CGroup instances repeated in a loop with other stats until end of file.
    - Always found directly after a TStat.
    - Always found directly before the next Record if not the end of file.
    - Contains statistics about every CGroup on the system.
