"""Structs and definitions used serialize/deserialize Atop statistics directly from log files.

Structs are declared in a way that will help provide as close to a 1 to 1 match as possible for debuggability
and maintenance. The _fields_ of every struct match their original name, however the struct names have been updated
to match python CamelCase standards. Each struct includes the following to help identify the original source:
    C Name: utsname
    C Location: sys/utsname.h

Struct ordering matches the C source to help with comparisons.
If structs match exactly from a previous version, they are reused via aliasing.

See https://github.com/Atoptool/atop for more information and full details about each field.
Using schemas and structs from Atop 2.6.0.
